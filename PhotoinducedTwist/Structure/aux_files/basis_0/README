If you wish to perform relaxation with LAMMPS, you must write the
basis file as required by the force-fields. For example, in the
case of MoS2 the intralayer Stillinger-Weber potential uses
3-atom-type basis (Mo-S-S). In our code, we infer the basis atom
types from the strings you provide in the basis_file_crys and
basis_file_crys_l2. If the strings you provide are (first column in
the basis files), "Mo S S", then the code will assume 2-atom-basis.
While performing LAMMPS relaxation with the aformentioned SW
potential, the code might crash. 

To overcome this, the first column is written as "Mo S1 S2". Our
code infers there are 3 atom types and correctly writes the lammps
data and input file.
