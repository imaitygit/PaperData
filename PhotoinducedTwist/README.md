## Structure 
We use [TWISTER](https://github.com/qtm-iisc/Twister) package
to generate the MoSe2/WSe2 heterobilayer. For more details,
please see [Structure/](./Structure/).  

## Relaxation
We use the [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org) package to relax
the structures using widely adopted classical interatomic
potentials.  The interactions within each MoSe2 and WSe2
layer are modeled using the Stillinger–Weber potential, while
the interlayer interaction between MoSe2 and WSe2 is
described by the Kolmogorov–Crespi potential. For more
details, please see [Relaxation](./Relaxation/).
